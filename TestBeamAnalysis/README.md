# Test Beam Analysis

## Documentation

## To-Do List

### For Riju
  - [x] Make timestamp plots but with orbit number and bunch crossing number
    * No orbit number or bunch crossing number saved in unpacked ROOT files -- probably not in RAW
    * Cameron says "that sucks"
  - [ ] Implement Segment Quality function from RecoMuon/MuonSeedGenerator/src/MuonCSCSeedFromRecHits.cc
  - [x] Implement setStyle function
    * Added full Plotter classes
  - [x] Incorporate any stray scripts into TestBeamAnalysis
    * Added database and current scrapers and whatever analysis scripts I had

### For Chris
  - [ ] Make plots of normalized segment nHits vs. attenuation
  - [ ] Write script for dumping event content information, initially for empty segments
    * Histograms of nSegments and nLCTs vs presence or no presence of the other -- why?
