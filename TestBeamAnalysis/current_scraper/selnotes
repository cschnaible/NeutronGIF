For the modern version, which
- doesn't close and open a new browser
- uses Marionette
Get the webdriver executable from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/WebDriver, rename it wires, and chmod +x it.
Add the path in which it sits to PATH.

'sel.py' inputs 'data' and outputs 'curr'
'chunks.py' inputs 'stuff' and outputs the end of each "chunk"
	any change in chamber, HV, or filter factors
'meh' is my hand-processed chunks output
	from chunks, grep -B1 ^meas stuff; echo. Then change the empty lines
	missing files, TMB dumps, etc. have been given a "dummy" name for script purposes
'times' is a copy of 'meh' but with human-readable timestamps in the required format (instead of raw files)
	emugif2.\{-}_160(d)(dd)_(dd)(dd)dd_UTC.raw -> (2).0(1).2016 (3):(4)
	Increment top minute (round up); watch out for 59->60, and octal 07->010, 08->9
'data' puts every two lines of 'times' on its own line for use in 'sel.py'
'ranges' is just the ranges from any of the files

9 of the measurements had unresponsive scripts even when the browser was closed; I did this by hand, marked with 'did work'.
